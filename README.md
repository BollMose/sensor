I want to know embedded system and hardware, so far I have the following chips,
# Raspberry Pi 3, model B
# Arduino uno
# PMS7003 for Air Quanlity
# si7021 & sht21* for humidility and temperature

* the temperature part is too high and I think it fails.

More devices I want to add:
# LED
# NFC chip
# Bluetooth
# audio
# light
#
